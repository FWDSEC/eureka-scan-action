# GitHub Action for Radar CLI
### One command. Complete AppSec coverage.

![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/eurekadevsecops/scan-action?color=2b82f6\&label=Release)
![Build](https://github.com/eurekadevsecops/scan-action/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)

</div>

**Scan your code for security vulnerabilities with [Radar CLI](https://github.com/EurekaDevSecOps/radarctl)** — the unified AppSec orchestration tool that runs multiple security scanners for complete AppSec coverage. Gain visibility into security vulnerabilities across your codebase, and optionally block deployments or manage aggregated results in a central platform such as Eureka ASPM or other vulnerability management tools.

This GitHub Action lets you run Radar CLI directly in your CI/CD pipeline. Detect secrets, dependency vulnerabilities, insecure code patterns, and configuration issues — all in one step.

---

**Vulnerability telemetry defaults to OFF** — no vulnerability findings are uploaded anywhere unless you explicitly enable this. When enabled, [Eureka ASPM](https://eurekadevsecops.com) gives you full visibility across repositories, environments, and scanner types.

---

## Key Features

* **Multi-scanner orchestration:** Run one or many scanners (Opengrep, Gitleaks, Grype, OWASP Dep-Scan, Veracode, and more)
* **Single SARIF report:** Consolidated findings across all scanners in one place
* **Optional Eureka ASPM integration:** Upload results for de-duplication, triage, and prioritization
* **GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) support:** Upload findings to your repository’s Security tab

---

## How It Works

1. Checks out your repository
2. Installs Node.js and Radar CLI (`npm i -g @eurekadevsecops/radar`)
3. Runs selected scanners
4. Generates a unified SARIF report
5. Optionally uploads results to:

   * GitHub Advanced Security
   * Eureka ASPM (if `EUREKA_AGENT_TOKEN` is provided)

## Supported Scanners

| Category          | Scanners                  | Description                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **SAST**          | Opengrep                  | Detects insecure code patterns                     |
| **Secrets**       | Gitleaks                  | Finds hardcoded credentials                        |
| **SCA**           | Grype, Dep-Scan, Veracode | Detects vulnerable dependencies                    |
| **Container/IaC** | Grype, Dep-Scan           | Scans Docker, OCI, and Singularity image formats   |

---

## Usage

### Example 1 — Local Scans

You can run this scan action entirely locally — it’s free, open source, and always will be. Use this option when you **don’t** want to upload findings to Eureka ASPM — ideal for forks, open-source, or isolated pipelines.

```yaml
name: Code Scan
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: eurekadevsecops/scan-action@v1
        with:
          scanners: "opengrep,gitleaks,grype"
```

---

### Example 2 — Upload Findings to Eureka ASPM

Use this when you want to see all your scan results in one place inside **Eureka ASPM**. Uploading findings adds extra capabilities: a clean dashboard, easier tracking over time, and smarter deduplication across scanners. Try it for free: [Eureka ASPM](https://eurekadevsecops.com).

```yaml
name: Code Scan and Upload
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: eurekadevsecops/scan-action@v1
        with:
          scanners: "opengrep,gitleaks,grype"
          token: ${{ secrets.EUREKA_AGENT_TOKEN }}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * `EUREKA_AGENT_TOKEN` auth token is required to integrate with the Eureka API.
> * If you omit either, no uploads occur.

---

### Example 3 — Upload Findings to Eureka ASPM and to GitHub Advanced Security

Use this if you like seeing security alerts where you work — in GitHub — but also want a full picture in Eureka: one dashboard for all scanners, deduped results, and long-term tracking across all of your repos.

```yaml
name: Code Scan and Upload
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: eurekadevsecops/scan-action@v1
        with:
          scanners: "opengrep,gitleaks,grype"
          token: ${{ secrets.EUREKA_AGENT_TOKEN }}
          export_findings_to_ghas: "true"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * `EUREKA_AGENT_TOKEN` auth token is required to integrate with the Eureka API.
> * If you omit either, no uploads occur.

## Inputs

| Name                      | Description                                                                   | Required? | Default                     | Example                               |

```

---

## Telemetry & Privacy

**Summary:** Radar CLI **doesn't** upload any vulnerability findings by default - only if you explicitly enable uploads to Eureka ASPM. Radar CLI collects minimal anonymous install and usage metrics to help us understand how the product is used and to help us make the product better. This helps us understand adoption, performance, and reliability across environments. 

### Uploading findings (opt-in)
If you set the `EUREKA_AGENT_TOKEN` environment variable, only then will Radar CLI transmit vulnerability findings (SARIF).

### Quick reference

| Scenario                                           | What gets sent |
|---------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Run `radar scan` locally with **no credentials**  | Local run. No vulnerability findings sent anywhere. Minimal anonymous install/usage metrics only (see above) |
| Run with `EUREKA_AGENT_TOKEN` environment variable set | Vulnerability findings (SARIF) plus anonymous install/usage metrics are uploaded |
| Air-gapped or offline environments                 | Anonymous install/usage metrics are dropped; no vulnerability findings are transmitted |

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                                             | Possible Cause                                               | Solution                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`report.sarif` not found**                    | The scan failed or didn’t produce output.                    | Check your workflow logs for errors from Radar CLI. Ensure the `folder_to_scan` path exists and scanners are valid. |
| **No findings uploaded to Eureka**             | Missing or invalid `EUREKA_AGENT_TOKEN`. | Make sure your token is stored as a GitHub Secret.                      |
| **“Permission denied” when uploading to GHAS** | Repository doesn’t have GitHub Advanced Security enabled.    | Enable GHAS under your repo’s *Security → Code scanning alerts* settings.                                           |
| **Network errors**                            | CI environment lacks outbound internet access.               | Ensure the runner can reach npmjs.org and eurekadevsecops.com endpoints.                                            |
| **Invalid Node.js version**                    | Runner uses an incompatible Node version.                    | This action installs Node 22 automatically, but check logs to confirm setup-node succeeded.                         |
| **“radar not found”**                          | CLI installation failed.                                     | Re-run the workflow; check npm logs for permission issues or caching problems.                                      |

> [!TIP]
> You can debug locally using the same CLI command as the action:
> `radar scan -s "opengrep,gitleaks,grype" -o report.sarif`

## Why Upload Findings to Eureka ASPM?

* **One Source of Truth:** Aggregate and de-duplicate findings across scanners — no more hunting through separate reports.
* **Less Noise, More Signal:** Prioritize risks contextually. Map findings to **OWASP ASVS**.
* **Faster Fixes:** Clear ownership, risk context, and remediation guidance help teams resolve issues quickly.
* **Built for Dev Workflows:** Integrates with GitHub, CI/CD, and local development so security fits naturally into your flow.
* **Track and Improve:** See how your project’s security posture evolves over time — from first commit to production.
